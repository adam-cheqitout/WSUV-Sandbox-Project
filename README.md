# WSUV-Sandbox-Project
A small Unity3D project to display the basic components within a Unity project.

This is intended to be a very simple environment with as few elements as possible to demonstrate the basic elements of game development that beginners will need to understand.

The project will also be a first introduction to GitHub for many of you, so if you need any guidance feel free to reach out for information.
